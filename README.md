# tiscamera-capture-image

Bash script for capturing snapshots from The Imaging Source (TIS) camera. It uses [TIS Linux SDK](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/tiscamera), so it has to be installed. Run this script with -h option to get options description and usage examples.

Feel free to modify this script. More information about TIS SDK can be found on its [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/tiscamera/wiki).
